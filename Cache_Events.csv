A belt of southwesterly mid- to upper-level winds up to about 50 knots preceded the axis of this trough and contributed to moderate to strong vertical wind shear, which favored the development of organized thunderstorms in the form of multicells and supercells. At the surface, winds exhibited an easterly component at times. These surface winds transported greater low-level moisture into the area from the Dakotas. Farther aloft, southwesterly winds near 10,000 feet MSL were present ahead of the Pacific trough axis and transported abundant amounts of Pacific moisture into the region. The resulting unusually-high humidity and daytime heating contributed to a weak to moderate instability especially over Southwest Montana. Also notable was a pronounced elevated mixed layer (EML), a term for an elevated dry layer of the lower to middle atmosphere, moving north from Utah and eastern Idaho.

The event began with a couple supercell thunderstorms over Yuma County Colorado and Cheyenne County Kansas. These are the primary storms that produced the large hail and tornadoes. The event evolved with several lines of storms forming, including a large line of storms that moved across Cheyenne, Rawlins, Decatur, Norton, Sherman, Thomas, Sheridan, and Graham counties in northwest Kansas. A second line of storms produced wind damage in Cheyenne County Colorado. These storms later produced heavy rain across Wallace, Logan, and Gove counties in Northwest Kansas.",,CSV,S848393,vil/2019/SEVIR_VIL_STORMEVENTS_2019_0701_1231.h5,473,vil,8/12/19 2:20,-120:-115:-110:-105:-100:-95:-90:-85:-80:-75:-70:-65:-60:-55:-50:-45:-40:-35:-30:-25:-20:-15:-10:-5:0:5:10:15:20:25:30:35:40:45:50:55:60:65:70:75:80:85:90:95:100:105:110:115:120,141202,848393,Thunderstorm Wind,37.97007739,-103.3201685,41.53991273,-98.98479413,#NAME?,384,384,384000,384000,0,254,0,43688.8472222222BEARDSLEY
